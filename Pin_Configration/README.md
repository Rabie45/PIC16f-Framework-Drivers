# PIC16f877a-Framework
 This is my own Framework for PIC16F877A microcontroll 
 
 ## This framework consists of 3 parts that you can found in Libs directory:
  - Configrations:
    - Have configrations for Ports(porta,b,c,d) in the microcontroll 

  - Util:
    - Have fuinction used to set a spacific bit or register with 1 or 0

  - Port:
    - That have the addresses of the ports (see the datasheet)

  - Pins:
     - This functions used by the framework user to make the port OR pin input or output high or low
