# PIC16f877a-Framework
 this is my own Framework for PIC16F877A microcontroll 
 
 this framework consists of 3 parts that you can found in Libs directory:
 1-configrations:
have configrations for Ports(porta,b,c,d) in the microcontroll 

2-util:
have fuinction used to set a spacific bit or register with 1 or 0

3-port:
that have the addresses of the ports (see the datasheet)

4-pins:
this functions used by the framework user to make the port OR pin input or output high or low
